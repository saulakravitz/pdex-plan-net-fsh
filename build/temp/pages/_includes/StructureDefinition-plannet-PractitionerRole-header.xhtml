<p>
<p>PractionerRole describes details about a provider, which can be a practitioner or an organization. When the provider is a practitioner, there may be a relationship to an organization. A provider renders services to patients at a location. When the provider is a practitioner, there may also be a relationship to an organization.
Practitioner participation in healthcare provider insurance networks may be direct or through their role at an organization.   Plannet-PractitionerRole could not be based on USCore because USCore-PractitionerRole Profile
requires an associated practitioner and an associated organization which does not take into account that not all providers are people, i.e. the provider could be a
group of people or a facility, nor does it take into account that not all practitioners are affiliated with an organization, i.e. they have a solo practice.</p>
