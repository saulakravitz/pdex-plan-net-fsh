Practitioner participation in healthcare provider insurance networks may be direct or through their role at an organization.   Plannet-PractitionerRole could not be based on USCore because USCore-PractitionerRole Profile

group of people or a facility, nor does it take into account that not all practitioners are affiliated with an organization, i.e. they have a solo practice.</p>
