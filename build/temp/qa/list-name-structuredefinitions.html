 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-newpatients.html">New Patients</a> New Patients indicates whether the practitioner is accepting new patients in their role</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-plannet-Endpoint.html">Plan-net Endpoint</a> The technical details of an endpoint that can be used for electronic services, such as for web services providing XDS.b or a REST endpoint for another FHIR server. This may include any security context information.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-plannet-HealthcareService.html">Plan-net HealthcareService</a> The HealthCareService  resource typically describes services offered by an organization/practitioner at a location. The resource may be used to encompass a variety of services covering the entire healthcare spectrum, including promotion, prevention, diagnostics, hospital and ambulatory care, home care, long-term care, and other health-related and community services.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-plannet-InsurancePlan.html">Plan-net InsurancePlan</a> An InsurancePlan is a discrete package of health insurance coverage benefits that are offered under a particular network type. A given payer’s products typically differ by network type and/or covered benefits. A plan pairs a product’s covered benefits with the particular cost sharing structure offered to a consumer. A given product may comprise multiple plans (i.e. each plan offers different cost sharing requirements for the same set of covered benefits).

InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits (i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the plan), and additional information about the offering, such as who it is owned and administered by, a coverage area, contact information, etc.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-plannet-Location.html">Plan-net Location</a> A Location is the physical place where healthcare services are provided, practitioners are employed, organizations are based, etc. Locations can range in scope from a room in a building to a geographic region/area.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-plannet-Network.html">Plan-net Network</a> A Network refers to a healthcare provider insurance network. A healthcare provider insurance network is an aggregation of organizations and individuals that deliver a set of services across a geography through health insurance products/plans. A network is typically owned by a payer.

In the PlanNet IG, individuals and organizations are represented as participants in a PLan-Net Network through the practitionerRole and Plan-Net-organizationAffiliation resources, respectively.

When the provider is a practitioner, there may also be a relationship to an organization. 
Practitioner participation in healthcare provider insurance networks may be direct or through their role at an organization.   Plannet-PractitionerRole could not be based on USCore because USCore-PractitionerRole Profile 
requires an associated practitioner and an associated organization which does not take into account that not all providers are people, i.e. the provider could be a 
group of people or a facility, nor does it take into account that not all practitioners are affiliated with an organization, i.e. they have a solo practice.</li>
 <li><a href="StructureDefinition-via-intermediary.html">Via Intermediary</a> A reference to an alternative point of contact (plannet-PractitionerRole, plannet-Organization, plannet-OrganizationAffiliation, or plannet-Location) for this organization</li>
